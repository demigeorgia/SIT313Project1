Hi Henry.

I'm sorry my video is a little larger than you asked for. The first video I filmed was 15 minutes long and included an explanation about how my code worked but unfortuantly I wasn't able to include that while keeping the video file size small. 

I hadn’t used Github before so I didn’t really understand what it was used for. Because of this and because I'm awful at reading instructions, I only created an account on Monday and uploaded my files. Since i sent you my code earlier in two seperate emails, could you please use that as an example of how I didn't write my code in a week?. Since I’ve created an account on Github, I now understand the concepts of pushing and pulling files and I'll use it for project 2. 

My project folder currently is named '28_07Ass1'. I didn't know how to rename it so I chose to leave it as it was instead of renaming it to something better.

This is the link to my github:

Thanks,
